2020 marks a new milestone in web design and development.

In 2006 we had _Web Design is 95% Typography_.<sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup>

In 2015 we couldn't decide if _It Is Web Or Photoshop?_.<sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup>

Now we know the new web is highly interactive and creative. It's like Flash in the nineties<sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup> with a twist: the content is more 3D / AR / VR like and in more useful ways interactive.

## Masters of Web

Since the twenty-tens I'm getting inspiration for web design from [Sitenspire](https://www.siteinspire.com/). Most of the entries in the `Masters of Web` series on this blog came from Siteinspire.

The last one in the series, published yesterday, draws the majority of entries from [Hover States](https://www.hoverstat.es/) &mdash; a site similar to Sitenspire representing the art / underground scene rather than the commercial web.

Even being an artist I couldn't use Hover States for inspiration until now. The entries were too experimental, even ugly sometimes.

With 2020 everything changed. Art won over commercial on the web when taking inspiration.

Please check the list of contenders for the latest `Masters of Web` and try to find the difference.
