  <div class='article__content'>
    
  <p>Good news to share. Technologies under the web&#39;s hood are taking over all other platforms.
Now you can use HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a website which installs and behaves like an app, both on mobile and desktop.
With one single effort now you can be present everywhere.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-of-end-of-web">The end of end of web</h2>
<p>Since the iPhone we&#39;ve been flooded by articles about the end of web. Nobody will need websites anymore and what only matters are the icons on your phone.</p>
<p>Few have noticed that two little icons are present <em>probably on every</em> phone&#39;s home screen: the mail and the browser. These must be things we all need.</p>
<p>Few have noticed the phone screen is too small to host all icons which will rise after the end of web. We can&#39;t have everything put behind icons which don&#39;t really interact together like the links did on web.</p>
<p>Since the iPhone, yes, the web is dead <em>if we mean by web discovery</em>, an analogy we&#39;ve got familiar with before the mobile era. Now if you do a quick check about your daily mobile phone usage pattern you&#39;ll realize the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2959-ten-apps-is-all-i-need">Ten apps is all I need</a> might be true.</p>
<p>When we say the web is dead we really say we&#39;ve managed to narrow our interests down to a handful of apps.
This isn&#39;t the holy grail to bury the web. Ironically, the web will save the app.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-apps">The problem with apps</h2>
<p>Is their gatekeepers.</p>
<p>If you ask Facebook or Google they&#39;ll probably say you need just one single app: theirs. If you check the top 10 app rankings you&#39;ll realize that&#39;s true. What about the rest of us? Will we live in an era determined by two or three players?</p>
<p>Probably not. What we need is to break the hegemony of what&#39;s on our phone home screen. If we can add freely icons to it then it&#39;s a win.
Freely without the hustle of going through the app store, without worrying about the upcoming annoying update requests, without having to look for the app version of a thing we like.</p>
<p>We can do it by marrying web technology with icons.</p>
<h2 id="the-context">The context</h2>
<p>Either you pay for it or you are the product. That&#39;s the first law of the internet and will stay as long as the internet. It&#39;s a fair law when you are aware of it.</p>
<p>As we&#39;ve learnt from the music industry napstered: there is room for both ways. You can get for free what&#39;s not really important for you, and, you can pay for it if it&#39;s really matters. And pay even more if you care about the creators.</p>
<p>Now the same napstering is happening for media and advertising. To those structures which are holding and supporting the app ecosystem gatekeepers.</p>
<p>While the transformation of the music industry required no breakthrough technological changes the transformation of the content industry needs one: a technology enabling a way to skip gatekeepers and let anybody take it&#39;s share on the homescreen.</p>
<p>That is the web stack.</p>
