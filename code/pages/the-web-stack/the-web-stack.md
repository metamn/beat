Good news to share. Technologies under the web's hood are taking over all other platforms.
Now you can use HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a website which installs and behaves like an app, both on mobile and desktop.
With one single effort now you can be present everywhere.

## The end of end of web

Since the iPhone we've been flooded by articles about the end of web. Nobody will need websites anymore and what only matters are the icons on your phone.

Few have noticed that two little icons are present *probably on every* phone's home screen: the mail and the browser. These must be things we all need.

Few have noticed the phone screen is too small to host all icons which will rise after the end of web. We can't have everything put behind icons which don't really interact together like the links did on web.

Since the iPhone, yes, the web is dead *if we mean by web discovery*, an analogy we've got familiar with before the mobile era. Now if you do a quick check about your daily mobile phone usage pattern you'll realize the [Ten apps is all I need](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2959-ten-apps-is-all-i-need) might be true.

When we say the web is dead we really say we've managed to narrow our interests down to a handful of apps.
This isn't the holy grail to bury the web. Ironically, the web will save the app.

## The problem with apps

Is their gatekeepers.

If you ask Facebook or Google they'll probably say you need just one single app: theirs. If you check the top 10 app rankings you'll realize that's true. What about the rest of us? Will we live in an era determined by two or three players?

Probably not. What we need is to break the hegemony of what's on our phone home screen. If we can add freely icons to it then it's a win.
Freely without the hustle of going through the app store, without worrying about the upcoming annoying update requests, without having to look for the app version of a thing we like.

We can do it by marrying web technology with icons.

## The context

Either you pay for it or you are the product. That's the first law of the internet and will stay as long as the internet. It's a fair law when you are aware of it.

As we've learnt from the music industry napstered: there is room for both ways. You can get for free what's not really important for you, and, you can pay for it if it's really matters. And pay even more if you care about the creators.

Now the same napstering is happening for media and advertising. To those structures which are holding and supporting the app ecosystem gatekeepers.

While the transformation of the music industry required no breakthrough technological changes the transformation of the content industry needs one: a technology enabling a way to skip gatekeepers and let anybody take it's share on the homescreen.

That is the web stack.
