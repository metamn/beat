Good news to share. Technologies under the web's hood are taking over all other platforms.
Now you can use HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a website which installs and behaves like an app, both on mobile and desktop.
With one single effort now you can be present everywhere.

## The end of end of web

Since the iPhone we've been flooded by articles about [the end of the web](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+end+of+the+web). Nobody will need websites anymore and what only matters are the icons on your phone.

Few have noticed that two little icons are present *probably on every phone's* home screen: the mail and the browser. These must be things we all need.

Few have noticed the phone screen is too small to host all icons which will rise after the end of web. We can't have the whole Internet put behind icons which don't really interact together like the good ol' links.

Since the iPhone, yes, the web is dead *if we mean by web: discovery*.
When we say the web is dead we say we've managed to narrow down our interests to a [handful of apps](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2959-ten-apps-is-all-i-need).

This isn't the way to bury the web.

## The problem with apps

Is their gatekeepers.

If you ask Facebook or Google they'll probably say you need just one single app: theirs. If you check the [top 10 app rankings](https://www.appannie.com/indexes/all-stores/rank/applications/?month=2016-04-01&country=US) you'll realize that's true. What about the rest of us? Will we live in an era run by a few?

Probably not. What we need is to break the hegemony of what's on our phone home screen. If we can freely add icons to it then it's a win.
Freely without the hustle of going through the app store, without worrying about the upcoming annoying update requests, without having to look for the *app version* of a thing we like.

We can do it by marrying web technology with icons.
