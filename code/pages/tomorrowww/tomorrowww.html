<p>I knew something is wrong when I read about the golden age of design is coming. It first came from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/t-magazine/design-golden-age.html?_r=0" title="New York Times">The New York Times</a>, then from everywhere.
IBM is hiring thousands of designers. Corporations all adopt design thinking. Startups are founded by designers. Banks and brands are buying entire design studios. <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/blog/design-in-tech-report-2015" title="Kleiner Perkins reports">Kleiner Perkins reports</a> and the O&#39;Reilly radar are just about #design.</p>
<p>Everything is around design yet everything is looking and working the same.
Maybe we don&#39;t really understand what design is.</p>
<h2 id="frank-chimero-david-hockney-zaha-hadid">Frank Chimero, David Hockney, Zaha Hadid</h2>
<p>I was reading Frank Chimero&#39;s <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/" title="The Web's Grain">The Web&#39;s Grain</a> in 2015 right the day it was published.</p>
<p>First I did not get it. It&#39;s a long article &mdash; an elegant rant on how broken the web design is, and how to fix it &mdash;, and I was in an angry mood.
I&#39;ve just built my first, Lonely Planet&#39;s Rizzo-like living styleguide which was simply lost in the noise.
Nobody cared about in spite it was a feat of arms &mdash; done by a single guy instead of a team, rethinked from scratch instead of being mixed together from plugins and generators, built with Gulp to make it available for all front-end developers.</p>
<p>Realizing styleguides are a simple hype &mdash; I saw adds on Twitter by even Deloitte offering styleguides, now all gone &mdash; was a disappointment.</p>
<p>This year I&#39;ve read again Frank&#39;s article, checked out David Hockney&#39;s approach to create art from independent parts, and got it. I knew the future of (web) design is about embracing the unknown, to create art on an ever changing canvas from the size of a watch to a skyscraper.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started immediately a new project, this very blog, to better analyze an understand the technique. Now I have an article split in two &mdash; Ideally and Practically &mdash; targeting two different audiences from the same content base. The content is split in sections, some sections go in the first article others in the second, and stay linked as Wikipedia. I&#39;ve assembled two views on the same subject from a single data, Hockney-style.</p>
<p>And then Zaha Hadid died. As always in these situations I&#39;m trying to pay my tribute by reviewing the artist&#39;s work. I was fascinated by how this <em>ugly</em> lady built something incomprehensible beautiful, places so unreal that people seems to be shy bank up.
And when reading <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/17/architecture" title="Alice Rawsthorn">Alice Rawsthorn&#39;s</a> article about how special Hadid buildings are, the heureka struck me hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You choose your own way of navigating the space and its content</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="devices-as-designers">Devices as designers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Devices choose their own way of assembling the space and its content</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is it. Devices choose how to put together the components forming the design. Our task is to design individual content chunks, equip them with metadata &mdash; add semantics &mdash; and then each device will assembly the page, the site according to it&#39;s unique hardware and software characteristics and best knowledge.</p>
<p>Sounds AI, sounds crazy and today is All Fool&#39;s Day.
But we will be rescued by semantics.</p>
<h2 id="semantics">Semantics</h2>
<p>First time I&#39;ve heard about this notion was in high school at the first computer science class. We&#39;ve been told code has two equally important main characteristics: syntax and semantics. Syntax seemed to be natural and semantics made me in secret happy. Immediately I&#39;ve thought if code has semantics then it can be my friend. I&#39;ve smiled.</p>
<p>Since then poor semantics got forgotten until came back again with Semantic HTML5. I saw it a few times earlier too but was so masked I couldn&#39;t recognize. Think CORBA. UML. YAML.</p>
<p>Semantic HTML was godsend. It took away half of the cognitive load writing code for websites. Since then I write <em>real</em> semantic HTML which outlines well in the HTML5 Outliner. And I&#39;m happy.</p>
<p>Working on the Ideally / Practically article &mdash; how an ideally perfect website can be designed and developed today &mdash; I&#39;ve found out everything rolls around semantics.</p>
<p>Content is converted into data and metadata to be more useful for the designer; It is equipped with microdata to be meaningful for bots; It is organized into a (BEM) folder structure to be accessible for any developer; It is componentized to gain significance and be more thoughtful.
Even <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design" title="Motion with Meaning: Semantic Animation in Interface Design">animations</a> are now semantic.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve started to add meaning to everything we do and work with because we&#39;ve realized our job, designing and developing for the web is herculean. We might need help to avoid the web fell upon us.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s make our job easier and with that more people happy. Especially those complaining about the fact that 99% of all websites look the same.
Let&#39;s play with the idea of creating websites, which like Zaha Hadid&#39;s buildings and David Hockney&#39;s paintings, are self-assembling themselves.
Now we have watch, tablet, laptop, desktop, TV, projector screens but in the future we will have thousands, no media queries can comprehend.</p>
<h2 id="history-unite-">History unite!</h2>
<p>At some stage we will need AI in our web design and development process. I don&#39;t know <em>when</em> AI will be able to replace us; I think we can keep our creative advantage for a while. If not in all areas at least in telling the machine about our content and the goals we want to accomplish with. Adding semantics to content, shaping content components to our maximum extent of knowledge, and let machines assembly the whole for different people, different scenarios and usage.</p>
<p>Let our content be both dead and alive in a <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/superposition">superposition</a> of states. Let&#39;s focus on describing and designing all those states and let the machine compose a picture to the armada of observers we can&#39;t be aware during our work.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s review again, and reconcile what <em>progress</em> meant five thousands year ago and means now, in a context everybody understands, for a new unknown universe waiting for us which we can&#39;t avoid.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about how <em>view</em> works, viewing things works, about the process of understanding.</p>
<p>We all know there is an Observer Observing an Object. What the Observer can see depends on its Observing capabilities and the properties of the Object. In history there were two totally different approaches to enhance understanding and define progress. Thousands of years ago it was involution &mdash; the progress inwards &mdash; when the Observer reduced its Observing capabilities to zero (sight, hear, smell, touch) and become one with the Object.</p>
<p>Since then we have evolution where we develop our Observing capabilities &mdash; progress outwards &mdash; to an extreme extent like the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>You see it&#39;s all about Observing; with involution we had Hermes Trismegistus become a god; with evolution we are building our own cloud where gods live.
Since Design is the Observing let&#39;s see how we can involve / evolve in this special case, in our beloved universe we call web.</p>
<h2 id="supercontent">Supercontent</h2>
<p>To cut in, let&#39;s equip all content with all states and let it rest in superposition, where it shows nothing, waiting for an Observer (visitor) and its Observing skillset (device).</p>
<p>What each visitors will see from our content depends on its mental capability (curiosity) and device capability (context). We can trust their capabilities &mdash; they are none of our concerns.  </p>
<p>With this step we let both the visitor and device (AI) to decide if they want to evolve or involve with/ into our content. It&#39;s not anymore a philosophical question but of individual will. Being responsible to cut out one of these crucial opportunities in such a connected era is something nobody wants to take.</p>
<p>What&#39;s left for us, designers and developers, is to focus on content states and write AI algorithms to make the device so smart to be able to assembly any picture from our content states.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-good-for-">What&#39;s good for?</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Let&#39;s make important things not to be just a hype ( to remove, its like 3)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s realize semantics reduces cognitive load and makes our lives easier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s take control over our content. Do not let to evolve to extremes like when we become a product; or to involve to zero when good things are forgotten (styleguide)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>let content be code;</p>
