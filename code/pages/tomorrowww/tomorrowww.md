I was reading Frank Chimero's <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/" title="The Web's Grain">The Web's Grain</a> in 2015 right the day it was published.

First I did not get it. It's a long article &mdash; an elegant rant on how broken the web design is, and how to fix it &mdash; and I was in an angry mood.
I've just built my first, Lonely Planet's Rizzo-like living styleguide which was simply lost in the noise.
Nobody cared about in spite it was a feat of arms &mdash; done by a single guy instead of a team, rethinked from scratch instead of being mixed together from plugins and generators, built with Gulp to make it available for all front-end developers.

Realizing styleguides are a simple hype &mdash; I saw adds on Twitter by even Deloitte offering styleguides &mdash; was a disappointment.

This year I've read again Frank's article, checked out David Hockney's approach to create art from independent parts, and got it. I knew the future of web design is about embracing the unknown, to create art on an ever changing canvas from the size of a watch to a skyscraper.

I've started immediately a new project, this very blog, to better analyze an understand the technique. Now I have an article split in two &mdash; Ideally and Practically &mdash; targeting two different audiences from the same content base. The content is split in sections, some sections go in the first article others in the second, and stay linked as a Wikipedia article. I've assembled two views on the same subject, Hockney-style.
