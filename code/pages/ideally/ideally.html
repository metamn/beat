  <blockquote>
<p>Ideally a website should ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To complete this sentence is almost impossible.</p>
<p>We all know designing and developing for the web is a <em>herculean</em> <sup id="footnote--1"><a href="#footnotes--1">1</a></sup> task.
Even if <em>there are no more problems on the front-end</em> <sup id="footnote--2"><a href="#footnotes--2">2</a></sup> no one can create the perfect website.</p>
<p>So why this post? At least we can try.
Many of us are thinking / dreaming / working on a perfect website. Even if the success is ephemeral &mdash; since web technology is ephemeral &mdash;, at least we can taste it for a second.</p>
<p>Massimo Vignelli was lucky. He had Photoshop, fixed viewport, no webservers, no SEO, no browsers, no bugs.
As disciples we should follow him, no matter the context and the medium became chaotic, universally brutal.</p>
<h2 id="1-deliver-the-message">1. Deliver The Message</h2>
<p>Every website sells something. A product, a service, a subscription, a photo, information. Design is the art and craft to make that sales happen. We are up to delight visitors yet deliver business goals.</p>
<p>To deliver the message, first, we have to know our audience. Then we will have to drive our users attention and will to act according to our goals.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s easier said than done&quot; &mdash; no, with <a href="http://metamn.io/beat/delivering-the-message">focus groups and focus points</a> we can easily achieve that.</p>
<p>There is a single prerequisite standing outside of the designer&#39;s &amp; developer&#39;s competence. The quality of content. If the content is perfect the website will be perfect.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-content">1.1 Content</h3>
<h3 id="1-2-focus-groups">1.2 Focus groups</h3>
<h3 id="1-3-focus-points">1.3 Focus points</h3>
<h2 id="2-fast">2. Fast</h2>
<p>You can have the best content and design which will produce no reach if your website is slow. Performance is a feature.</p>
<p>Performance optimization is a complete industry. Servers, containers, cloud, scaling, back-end, database, devops, caching, content delivery networks, security.</p>
<p>But don&#39;t give up. You can have a website up and running without all these. It&#39;s called <em>static website</em>. It strips down all above and it is right now suitable for all kind of marketing sites, landing pages, and even e-commerce. Everywhere where the focus is on presentation and not on heavy data input from your users.</p>
<p>A static website is the fastest possible today. And is 100% secure. And a future-proof solution. Server technologies tend to realize the advantages of going static and they are creating solutions in that direction.</p>
<p>Technically if you have a static website built upon a <em>JSON file-database</em> <sup id="footnote--3"><a href="#footnotes--3">3</a></sup> any backend can be connected to it now or later.</p>
<p>This is liberating. When you think in website speed first think in front-end speed then server speed.
There are battle-tested, common tools and technologies which are making front-end code and design the fastest possible.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-html">2.1 HTML</h3>
<h3 id="2-2-css">2.2 CSS</h3>
<h3 id="2-3-javascript">2.3 Javascript</h3>
<h3 id="2-4-images">2.4 Images</h3>
<h2 id="3-compatible">3. Compatible</h2>
<h3 id="3-1-browsers">3.1 Browsers</h3>
<p>We have spent at least ten years trying to make websites run seamlessly in all browsers. The solution recently found is very elegant: it is effortless and it is transparent for the developer making the problem like never existed.</p>
<p>Project owners must be aware the era when half of the bill was for fixing Internet Explorer bugs is gone. Cross browser compatibility is now default.</p>
<h3 id="3-2-devices">3.2 Devices</h3>
<p>Half of the bill now is responsiveness.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m in a constant hunt for perfect mobile web experiences since the beginning of responsive web design in 2010. Now in 2016 I can say only <em>1 out of 10 websites</em> from the highly respectable <a href="http://siteinspire.com">Siteinspire</a> offer a fully enjoyable mobile experience.</p>
<p>Remember we are on the quest for a perfect website. All devices must be equal.</p>
<p>During that 5-6 years spent with designing and developing responsive websites I&#39;ve realized a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There is no global strategy like mobile-first or progressive enhancement or grateful degradation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designing in the browser solves half of the problem. If the designer is up-to-date and hands-on with the latest browser capabilities and quirks &mdash; the designer is also a front-end developer &mdash; the project time, budget, effort is reduced at least with 50%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Making a site responsive is instant. You create a component on big screen and test immediately on smaller screens. Tweak until is perfect everywhere. This makes the component to be very solid, uncluttered, minimal, focusing only on the major goals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
