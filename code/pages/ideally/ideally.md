> Ideally a website should ...

To complete this sentence is almost impossible.

We all know designing and developing for the web is a *herculean* <sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup> task.
Even if *there are no more problems on the front-end* <sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup> no one can create the perfect website.

So why this post? At least we can try.
Many of us are thinking / dreaming / working on a perfect website. Even if the success is ephemeral &mdash; since web technology is ephemeral &mdash;, at least we can taste it for a second.

Massimo Vignelli was lucky. He had Photoshop, fixed viewport, no webservers, no SEO, no browsers, no bugs.
As disciples we should follow him, no matter the context and the medium became chaotic, universally brutal.


## 1. Deliver The Message

Every website sells something. A product, a service, a subscription, a photo, information. Design is the art and craft to make that sales happen. We are up to delight visitors yet deliver business goals.

To deliver the message, first, we have to know our audience. Then we will have to drive our users attention and will to act according to our goals.

"It's easier said than done" &mdash; no, with [focus groups and focus points](http://metamn.io/beat/delivering-the-message) we can easily achieve that.

There is a single prerequisite standing outside of the designer's & developer's competence. The quality of content. If the content is perfect the website will be perfect.


## 2. Fast

You can have the best content and design which will produce no reach if your website is slow. Performance is a feature.

Performance optimization is a complete industry. Servers, containers, cloud, scaling, back-end, database, devops, caching, content delivery networks, security.

But don't give up. You can have a website up and running without all these. It's called *static website*. It strips down all above and it is right now suitable for all kind of marketing sites, landing pages, and even e-commerce. Everywhere where the focus is on presentation and not on heavy data input from your users.

A static website is the fastest possible today. And is 100% secure. And a future-proof solution. Server technologies tend to realize the advantages of going static and they are creating solutions in that direction.

Technically if you have a static website built upon a *JSON file-database* <sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup> any backend can be connected to it now or later.

This is liberating. When you think in website speed first think in front-end speed then server speed.
There are battle-tested, common tools and technologies which are making front-end code and design the fastest possible.
