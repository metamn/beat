The term unicorn run down lately for well founded reasons.

There is a bubble around startup unicorns with high valuation and no profit.

Unicorn people&mdash;those who both design and code&mdash;got overwhelmed by the fast expanding internet ecosystem.

An unicorn today must be capable to do graphic design; UX research; responsive UI design; progressive and reactive front-end code; animation and motion design; deal with APIs, microservices, containers and plain old servers on back-end.

That is at least herculean<sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup> if not impossible.

No wonder the once 1:1 ratio on Hacker News' [Who is Hiring?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14460777) vs. [Seeking Freelancer?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14460778) is now 10:1.

## Go big or go home

Yep. Either you'll get employed, create your own studio with 3-4 people, or, go big and stay freelance.

Me personally I don't like managing people or being managed. I don't like the creative process hanging on external factors. I'm for the constant flow from the birth to the execution of an idea. More art than engineering. More free creation and improvisation than coordination.

To stay freelancer and unicorn the terms *freelancer and unicorn* must be redefined. Stripped down technologically and mounted up business wise.

It's clear no single individual can keep up with the technology anymore and it's clear there are less freelance jobs out there.

The new unicorn should be less dependent on technology change, and, more capable to generate revenue on her own.

## The idea  

For the long run one should think in convergence rather than fragmentation.

Fragmentation is when new things are born; convergence is when they go stable.

Our industry is yes fragmented but merging to a common sense. The boundary between native mobile and web, touch and non-touch, digital vs. print aesthetics is disappearing. It is clear where revenue can be generated on the internet and where it is impossible.

I think if you have original content which is capable to grow, and, it flows seamlessly on all channels (mobile, web, print) then you have a case for a successful solo / small team business.
