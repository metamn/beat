Design systems; declarative, component-based, cross-platform user interface libraries; data-driven applications; service oriented architectures &mdash; the new standards &mdash; are replacing monoliths; hide complexities; and enable better reuse of resources.

No wonder they are budget friendly.

Sounds like tech-fiction? These are products of Google, Facebook and Amazon.

Too big for me? Right. It might be. But the era of lonely heroes &mdash; David Heinemeier Hansson of Ruby and Rails, Guido van Rossum of Python, and co. &mdash; are gone. The new standards are so complex they require strong corporate backers beside vivid open source communities.

## Design systems

Brad Frost has an excellent example in [Create design systems, not pages](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/) to catch the essence of these new standards.

This kind of thinking:

> “We’re a startup looking to launch a five-page website this October…” &bull;
> “Brad, how long will the homepage take to build?” &bull;
> “How are we ever going to redesign this university website that contains over 30,000 pages?!”

... is simply doesn't scale.

Nor the result.

Which was _imagined_ by designers hidden behind ivory towers called Photoshop; then _executed_ by poor developers based on divine comps which are ...

> The most effective way to show your clients what their website will never look like. ([_Stephen Hay_](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/#visually-repaired))

Design systems try to fix these.

Instead of tools invented for graphic design user interface design started to have it's own specialized tools where design systems _can_ be created.

Instead of monolithic pages designers started to think in small, atomic components which are self-sufficient and easily reusable, composable.

Instead of authority reason became the main ingredient in the designer &larr;&rarr; developer collaboration.

The results?

1. Scaling. Google, the inventor of the Material Design System has the most uniform looking products today across all platforms and screens.
2. Perhaps better [budget](http://metamn.io/beat/the-designer-who-doesnt-code/).
3. Definitively a [healthier company culture](http://metamn.io/beat/design-systems-are-a-cultural-challenge/).
