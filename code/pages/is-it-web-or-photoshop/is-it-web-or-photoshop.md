2015 was the year when finally the browser became a display medium such powerful as print, and, designing for / in the browser as rich as using Photoshop or Illustrator.

2015 was also the year when 99% of the designers were complaining about uniform looking websites and apps, while the rest *(of us)* were working and pushing itâ€™s boundaries forward.

In 2016 I'll experiment with creating print-like, magazine-like, tv-like websites.
I believe the web is not dead, in fact, currently is living its renaissance.

## Can you tell which one is Photoshop or a website?
