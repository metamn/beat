The last half year I've spent with creating a Design system with the latest and bravest web technologies: React, JavaScript and TypeScript, Next.js.

A total failure.

I've never felt so bad in my career. I went to a point to give up everything.
I've done all in my powers to get the job done and finally all fell apart.

Meantime I've become frustrated, anxious and not a better but a worse person.
The technologies "Making the world better (TM)" made me inhuman.

## The idea

[Five years ago](http://metamn.io/beat/creating-a-styleguide-with-gulp/) I've managed to put together a living styleguide with HTML, SCSS, JSON, vanilla JavaScript, and Gulp, hosted on Github as a static page.

At that time there were no styleguides, and there were no / few individuals creating such thing alone. Styleguides were done by companies with better resources.

That styleguide still powers this blog, and gave me satisfaction with sites created with featured in online galleries.

Last autumn, with a year+ background in React, a little cash on hand I took a sabbatical to create a better version of that styleguide with better technologies:

- React, as the front-end framework.
- A CSS-in-JS library, which scales. (During the years I saw SCSS can't scale)
- Next.js as the go-to framework for static sites. (Tried Gatsby before and left because of the ugliest code base I've met in a commercial product so far.)
