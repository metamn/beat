WordPress, a company started at the same time like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Shopify &mdash; which now powers 30% of all websites &mdash; is rolling out a new version of it's web app this month with a game changing feature called Gutenberg.

Gutenberg is a new web editor enabling people to design their own website visually.

This is not the first attempt to let people freely design their own websites. Atavist, Wix, ReadyMag, Jux have all tried before but, as it always happens, after ahead-of-time-innovation there is a momentum when and attempt becomes truly successful.

That momentum is now. Powered by WordPress via it's huge reach and ecosystem together with React a revolutionary tool created by Facebook.  

These two combined can't miss to make everyone a designer.

Log in to WordPress, throw together some React components called Gutenberg blocks, and voila, in a few hours your website is ready.

## Seismic

When everybody is a designer seismic shift happens in the background. A few classic software jobs &mdash; UI/UX designer, front-end and back-end developer &mdash; will sink together with entire industries.

There won't be any need for these roles and their tools. People will use the browser to design their online presence in real time.

They won't fire up Photoshop or Sketch to design and wait for God / miracle / yet another developer to implement their creation.

They will fire up the browser and make changes in a *what you see is what you get* fashion. There won't be need for any dashboard, back-end, content management system, e-commerce engine there as we know today.

Components will be everywhere. A mix of UI/UX design, front-end code with back-end support &mdash; in a completely new way. You just drop content on them and pick up a style to display. Nothing more.

## Painful

The democratisation of design starts with WordPress and it will painful for the half of the industry in a similar way like Artificial Intelligence is taking away jobs.

Instead of millions of themes, hundreds of visual theme builders, dozens of content management and e-commerce systems there will be a few component frameworks, compatible with each other, using universal design systems like Google's Material Design.

Personally I'm happy with this. Our industry is overpopulated, deeply perverted, with lots of charlatans and overnight pixel pushers reinventing the same wheel every day hidden behind soundy job titles for large sums of money driving the global gentrification. It's time to cool down and make a reality check.

## The scenario

What really concerns me is how people with no design education and aesthetic sense will manage to come up with a good looking, finished website?

And how we can avoid all those websites looking the same?

People fed up with social networks will start soon leaving the silos and looking for something original to express themselves even on the cost of the likes. 

They'll flock into WordPress; choose a design system; pick up some components and color schemes; in an afternoon they'll come up with the solution. In ecstasy. The next day they'll wake up and realize a.) they won't win the next Awwwards and b.) their creation looks like almost as the guys' next door.  

What we can do in the next short years to satisfy them all? We don't want every new site look alike neither to be ugly. We don't want to make people disappointed by the web immediately after a social network exodus.
