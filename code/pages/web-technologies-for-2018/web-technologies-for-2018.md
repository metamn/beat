  There is an [accompanying quick rant]() to this article discussing how interactive web decomposed the monolithic approach into atomic components and microservices. I hope you'll enjoy it.

  This twin article is highly technical about how we've got to components: to the new paradigm for app / web / development / design which already dominate the edges of the industry.

  Interactivity, scalability and designer-developer communication led to components. Let's see how.

  ## Interactivity

  Web 2.0 introduced commenting and sharing which led to the rise of endless REST and MVC frameworks. New ways to interact with the server and new ways to interact with users.

  Web sites became web apps; web servers became web services; web developers became front-end and back-end engineers; web designers became UX, UI specialists; programming languages were replaced by Javascript; frameworks with modules; content management systems with APIs; relational databases with document databases; imperative code with reactive code; you name it.

  At the end we've come down to the UNIX philosophy<sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup> of fully separating concerns<sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup>. A bottom-up, minimalist approach standardized into so called web components<sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup>.    

  ## Scalability

  Web components are dealing only with HTML, Javascript, DOM and they do completely skip CSS. An indispensable technology begging for a reform like its peers. Yet a step-child of the W3C.

  Since inception nobody at the World Wide Web Consortium dealt with the problems of CSS at scale<sup id="footnote--4">[4](#footnotes--4)</sup>. In this wilderness came some fine folks form Russia and gave us BEM, a lonely cowboy from US who gave us Atomic Components &mdash; but this was not enough &mdash; and we've got now CSS in JS from the social network.

  To settle things down an Australian with his crew invented Interoperable CSS<sup id="footnote--5">[5](#footnotes--5)</sup> from where CSS Modules were born.

  With that, finally, CSS follows the current Javascript workflow and web components model. It became cohesive &mdash; has one single purpose; decoupled &mdash; no class-bindings to HTML; and orthogonal &mdash; no global classes to make change ripple to unwanted places.

  With web components and CSS modules we've everything covered on the technical part.

  ## Communication

  As sarcastic as I am the [should designers code?](https://www.google.ro/search?q=should+designers+code) debate always excites me. I do both &mdash; and there are about 17,900,000 results in that Google search.

  However that chicken fight led to a very pleasant outcome: styleguides a.k.a. design systems. I've been using them since the beginning<sup id="footnote--6">[6](#footnotes--6)</sup> and I can see the benefit. Perfect designer &larr;&rarr; developer communication.

  Design systems<sup id="footnote--7">[7](#footnotes--7)</sup> are a set of visual, interactive components created by designers to be translated 1:1 to web components by developers. They are the first real bridge between design and development. They've replaced Photoshop comps as web apps replaced web sites.

  ## Web Components

  Interactive user interfaces decomposed not just web technologies but design thinking and frameworks. Today the dice rolls around components and modules. Everything is built bottom up with interactivity, accessibility, interoperability and scalability in mind.

  It sounds too much but is the bare enough minimum to make the web great again.
