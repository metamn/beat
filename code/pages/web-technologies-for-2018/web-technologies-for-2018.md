  There is an [accompanying quick rant]() to this article discussing how interactive web decomposed the monolithic approach into atomic components and microservices. I hope you'll enjoy it.

  This twin article is highly technical about how we've got to components: the new paradigm for app / web / development / design dominating the upcoming years.

  It turns out not only interactivity but also scalability and designer-developer communication led to components. Let's see them.

  ## Interactivity

  Web 2.0 introduced commenting and sharing which led to REST and MVC frameworks. New ways to interact with the server and new ways to interact with users.

  Web sites became web apps; web servers became web services; web developers became front-end and back-end engineers; web designers became UX, UI specialists; programming languages were replaced by Javascript; frameworks with modules; content management systems with APIs; relational databases with document databases; imperative code with reactive code. You name it.

  At the end we've come down to the UNIX philosophy<sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup> of fully separating concerns<sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup>. A bottom-up, minimalist approach standardized into web components<sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup>.
