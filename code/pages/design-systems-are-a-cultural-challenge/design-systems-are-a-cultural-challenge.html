  <p>We all love Design Systems. For their clarity, comfort &mdash; and the quietude inserts in the back of our head. Finally, we are on the right path.</p>
<p>However, we might not be immediately capable to embrace it. They require change of mind and change in company culture.</p>
<h2 id="what-design-systems-are">What Design Systems Are</h2>
<p>It&#39;s 2019 yet many articles with such titles are popping up and get voted up constantly. Even silly or basic ones. People &mdash; it seems &mdash; are still familiarizing with the idea.</p>
<p>I find this strange.</p>
<p>Google&#39;s Material Design is many years old; so it is Lonely Planet&#39;s Rizzo. React and co. offers myriads of design system and living styleguide plugins and implementations. Sketch has a plugin to export a design system into React components without code written. Even this blog was created using a design system four years ago.</p>
<p>Why Design Systems are not ubiquitous?</p>
<p>The answer was not obvious until I&#39;ve met a company willing to implement it but failed on the road.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Development Team</em>: Yes, we can see now how a Design System can constitute the basis for all our other assets (websites);</li>
<li><em>Design Team</em>: Yes, we&#39;ve been designing with design systems since 2007 and we see the commercial capacity.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of the enthusiasm and good will we&#39;ve ended up with no design comps.</p>
<h2 id="what-difficulties-design-systems-impose">What difficulties Design Systems impose</h2>
<p>In this particular case &mdash; which might be similar as well for other companies like this in size and cultural heritage &mdash; the design team was not able to deliver a design system. On code, we&#39;ve ended up with components so big in number and redundancy they&#39;ve escaped under control.</p>
<p>And the lessons are:</p>
<h3 id="deconstruction">Deconstruction</h3>
<p>User interfaces created with a design system are not a continuously expanding thing like the comps of the past were. They are canonical, they deconstruct instead of expand. They ask the question <em>How we can re-use?</em> instead of <em>Let&#39;s quickly add a ...</em>.</p>
<p>There are no hacks instead there is contemplation. If an element in a design system is singular, not reused elsewhere &mdash; it shouldn&#39;t be part of the system.</p>
<h3 id="systems-thinking">Systems thinking</h3>
<p>Artists are not engineers. Some minds are not capable of systems thinking. A person with excellent aesthetic skills can&#39;t be expected to oversee all the <em>mechanical</em> parts of an user interface from various kind of links and link states to responsive and re-usable page structures &mdash; from atoms to molecules and organisms.</p>
<h3 id="code-components">Code components</h3>
<p>Design systems require to be implemented with code components. A relatively new paradigm, again, components eliminate the chance of hacking. No dev can jump in and change quickly a button&#39;s color or reduce the size of an image.</p>
<p>First the system has to be understood.</p>
<h3 id="real-teamwork">Real teamwork</h3>
<p>Design thinking and design systems are more math than art. They are a combination of creativity and engineering skills. It&#39;s a teamwork where both parties &mdash; designers and developers &mdash; are equal and decisions are made on best practices, consensus, rather than authority.</p>
<p>If there is no perfect systems thinking during design the code will reveal it.</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Expensive first, then cheaper on long term.</p>
<h2 id="tldr-">TLDR;</h2>
<p>React is a challenge (link here);
So it is DS. For the designer, the developer, for the management. New skills, new kind of decision making.</p>
