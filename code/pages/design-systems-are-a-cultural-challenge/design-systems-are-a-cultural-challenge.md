We all love Design Systems. For their clarity, comfort, and the quietude inserts in the back of our head: finally, we are on the right path.

However, we might not be immediately capable to embrace it. They require change of mind and a new company culture.

## What Design Systems Are

It's 2019 yet many articles with such titles are popping up constantly and are upvoted. Even silly or basic ones. People &mdash; it seems &mdash; are still familiarizing with the idea.

I found this strange. Google's Material Design is years old; so it is Lonely Planet's Rizzo. React and co. offers myriads of design system and living styleguide plugins and implementations. Sketch has a plugin to export a design system into React components without code written. Even this blog was created using a design system four years ago.

Why Design Systems are not ubiquitous?
