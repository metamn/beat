A new trend emerged in web design the last year &mdash; Brutalist websites<sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup>.

It is fueled by New Aesthetics<sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup> and it is for the new generation:

> In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today's webdesign.

Yes, we are fed up with the mainstream web, not just by it's look but by it's practices, tools and processes.

We are aware behind the Same Looking Shiny UI&trade; there is the same Make The World Better&copy; bullshit marching exclusively for profit while destroying the basic principles of the web and the internet &mdash; us.

## A Short History

In 2014 Pascal Deville<sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup> started to collect and showcase websites
where  

> It’s not only what you can see, it’s also how it’s built<sup id="footnote--4">[4](#footnotes--4)</sup>

In the Web History Museum this phrase will be filed as the one which napstered an entire generation of graphic
designers.

Who proclaimed themselves web / UI / UX designers using tools nothing to do with the browser, and, requiring an armada of *poor* front-end developers to sweat out their creations to fit the web, while they can argue endlessly about [Should designers code?](https://www.google.com/search?q=should+designers+code)

Well, that era is gone.<sup id="footnote--5">[5](#footnotes--5)</sup>

## How This Could Happen?

Certainly not without [The Drudge Report](http://drudgereport.com/) which runs the same design since 1997,
still serving three million page visits per day, and [shaping the global worldview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Breitbart).

And not without [37 Signals](http://37signals.com/manifesto) who brought The Drudge Report into the attention
of the design and development community, [continuously](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1407-why-the-drudge-report-is-one-of-the-best-designed-sites-on-the-web).

And not without an art school ([Yale University School of Art](http://art.yale.edu/)), a modern media company ([Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-yahoo)), a fashion label ([Balenciaga](http://balenciaga.com/)), heavyweights like [Google and AIGA](http://designcensus.org/#!/section/about) and the one who spread the fire [Y Combinator / Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Or [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/).

## So What Is Brutalist Web Design?

The new aesthetics in web design.

With the brutalist movement something new started. People went back to code editors to create websites by hand &mdash; skipping third-party, non-web-native user interface design tools prefilled with common knowledge making websites looking uniform.

The idea of design silos and brand-specific design thinking is dropped: no more bootstrap, flat design, material design&co.

It's like back to the nineties and reinventing web design. You start from scratch, on your own, with an editor and a browser, and you build bottom up by experimenting instead of being the direction told.

It's about creativity vs. the bandwagon, about crafting your own instead of mixing together from popular pieces.

And is more about content. You can't create a brutalist website on a non-brutalist subject.

## Content

> Web design is 95% typography<sup id="footnote--6">[6](#footnotes--6)</sup>

was said back in 2006. In 2015 Zeldman reduced to 90%. That 5% should be images.

We've got used with this idea. Design is what makes the content work. Not vice versa.
We take a content and present the best way possible to act on an audience, using design.

When reading through the interviews associating the featured sites on Brutalist Websites I came across the same paradigm over and over. In majority of cases the content and the intent with the content resulted in a design which can be called brutalist.

## Why is this so important?

We know we live in the era of fake news. When the elites and their mainstream media lost the ground with the reality<sup id="footnote--7">[7](#footnotes--7)</sup>.
When news are eating us.

When New York Times says a day before the US elections one candidate has 80% chance of win.
When other news disrupt real life violence. When your weather app says today the temperature will be between 10-23 &grade; C and you see 27&grade;C current temperature on the same screen.
When you book a room at $26 on Airbnb and it gets $31 at checkout.

Somehow all of us &mdash; are made to &mdash; loose the ground with reality. Our apps, phones, service providers, e-commerce and media outlets all think we are stupid. Really stupid. Like we have no right to get facts just the finest onboarding.

I, naive, see a change with the brutalist movement. Back to roots, back to content, back to individual expression through design.
