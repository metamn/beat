A new trend emerged in web design the last year &mdash; Brutalist websites<sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup>.

It is fueled by New Aesthetics<sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup> and it is for the new generation:

> In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today's webdesign.

Yes, we are fed up with the mainstream web, not just by it's look but by it's practices, tools and processes.

We are aware behind the Same Looking Shiny UI&trade; there is the same Make The World Better&copy; bullshit marching exclusively for profit while destroying the basic principles of the web and the internet &mdash; us.

## A Short History

In 2014 Pascal Deville<sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup> started to collect and showcase websites
where  

> It’s not only what you can see, it’s also how it’s built<sup id="footnote--4">[4](#footnotes--4)</sup>

In the Web History Museum this phrase will be filed as the one which napstered an entire generation of graphic
designers.

Who proclaimed themselves web / UI / UX designers using tools nothing to do with the browser, and, requiring an armada of *poor* front-end developers to sweat out their creations to fit the web, while they can argue endlessly about [Should designers code?](https://www.google.com/search?q=should+designers+code)

Well, that era is gone.<sup id="footnote--5">[5](#footnotes--5)</sup>

## How This Could Happen?

Certainly not without [The Drudge Report](http://drudgereport.com/) which runs the same design since 1997,
still serving three million page visits per day, and [shaping the global worldview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Breitbart).

And not without [37 Signals](http://37signals.com/manifesto) who brought The Drudge Report into the attention
of the design and development community, [continuously](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1407-why-the-drudge-report-is-one-of-the-best-designed-sites-on-the-web).

And not without an art school ([Yale University School of Art](http://art.yale.edu/)), a modern media company ([Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-yahoo)), a fashion label ([Balenciaga](http://balenciaga.com/)), heavyweights like [Google and AIGA](http://designcensus.org/#!/section/about) and the one who spread the fire [Y Combinator / Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Or [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/).

## So What Is Brutalist Web Design?

The new aesthetics in web design.

With the brutalist movement something new started. People went back to code editors to create websites by hand &mdash; skipping third-party, non-web-native user interface design tools prefilled with common knowledge making websites looking uniform.

The idea of design silos and brand-specific design thinking is dropped: no more bootstrap, flat design, material design&co.

It's like back to the nineties and reinventing web design. You start from scratch, on your own, with an editor and a browser, and you build bottom up by experimenting instead of being the direction told.

It's about creativity vs. the bandwagon, about crafting your own instead of mixing together from popular pieces.

And is more about content. You can't create a brutalist website on a non-brutalist subject.

## Content

They say 90% of web design is typography &mdash; ergo content.
