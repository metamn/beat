Around 80% of my work is not visible. They are not featured in my portfolio &mdash; they just exists somewhere.

Reasons vary:

- Working two years for a startup which fails to launch.
- Creating five variations of a website and only one is used.
- Learning and experimenting with results not packaged for production / distribution / public view.
- Projects abandoned / not paid by the client.
- Projects under non-disclosure agreement.
- Projects I'm not proud of.
- Works re-designed during the following years.
- Websites gone extinct.
- Bids where your project doesn't win.

I've long planned to go through my repositories and re-launch them at least locally on my machine. Since in the last decade lots of technologies came and go &mdash; re-launching my old works I knew won't be easy.

Each tech stack has to be reproduced first to be able to serve the website / app built upon. Which isn't trivial after a good few years. Old tech seems to be not always working in a current environment.

I've got lucky &mdash; since the beginning I'm using static site generators whenever possible. Most of these sites can be re-launched. Other, heavier stacks like WordPress and Ruby on Rails &mdash; maybe some other time.

## Notes

The works presented below follow a timeline. Sometimes they have an associated website, sometimes are just a screenshot. And remember: none of them is production ready.

## Smuff

My dearest project so far. And my best work perhaps until today. From around 2010. Also the logo is handmade.
