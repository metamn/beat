This year was sabbatical.

I took a deep breath and first time in my life I started thinking on long term.

In a 2017 article *Unicorn forever*<sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup> I've already laid out the principles of how to do that:

{% endmarkdown %}

{% set list = list %}
{% include "../../framework/design/decorations/list-expandable/list-expandable.html.swig" %}

{% markdown %}

Less dependent on technology made me choose WordPress as my main framework. Why? Because it powers 30% of all websites today. Quite a performance yet few truly realizes that &mdash; giving room for growth.

Generating revenue on your own means no more freelancing. Depending on clients to make revenue is nothing to do with generating it. You need a product or a software as a service for that.

Fragmentation is when new things are born; convergence is when they go stable.

In this spirit instead of inventing something new I've kept pursuing my age-long goal, hobby, interest: creating and enjoying knowledge.

This is how More Themes Baby and the Log Lolla theme<sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup> was born.

## Log Lolla

Gust<sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup>, the first attempt to create and enjoy knowledge is an immense personal success. Having it gave me a complete and stable worldview &mdash; no matter what. Today I acknowledge all and any kind of news, reflect them on the Gust framework, and move on without being touched in any sense. Gust is highly *relaxing* when used.

Beat, this current blog is another satisfaction. It's quite small, good looking, and timeless. Good to come back to it from time to time. Its *continuity* I value more and more. It helps me track the  progress and the direction of my professional path.

Pulse<sup id="footnote--4">[4](#footnotes--4)</sup> is a handsome little clever companion to Beat. It measures my objectivity. Glad today I'm on the edge.

Log Lolla meant to converge all these above into a single tool and let people capture, grow knowledge, enjoy the process and the results, get back relaxation, calm and feedback when a fix is needed.

It's far from being there but it's on a good track.

## Knowledge

> Everybody is rushing to create knowledge; humans are very poor at, computers are far better.

This was the first summary<sup id="footnote--5">[5](#footnotes--5)</sup> I've created after a year spent on studying knowledge. In spite computers had already won the battle I'm betting on helping humans to keep up.

Why? Computers have another kind of knowledge than us. I'm calling it *cold* knowledge, distant knowledge, objective knowledge &mdash; which has nothing or less to do with an individual's own perception.

Write a blog post and let the AI tag it. You will find those tags all true but not fully significant in your opinion, the one who wrote the article. This is cold knowledge. It's knowledge but in a sense useless for you.

AI will become more and more perfect, objective, cold, soulless while there is a growing need<sup id="footnote--6">[6](#footnotes--6)</sup> for a personal, subjective space where one can freely play, experiment, grow and even be fallible.

## WordPress

I'm sure the WordPress bet on long term will pay off: it's open source, it's significant, it's web.

On short term, after a year, I'm wondering how unproductive I was. It's either due to WordPress' big internal code mess, or to that fact that code, like music or literature needs to be rewritten 10 times to reach a debt-free state<sup id="footnote--7">[7](#footnotes--7)</sup>.

I keep investing in WordPress<sup id="footnote--8">[8](#footnotes--8)</sup> by breaking it down from a monolith into a re-usable set of components yet keeping the best practices.

Taking the product (a.k.a technology) risk out of the venture is the first step needs to be perfectly done.

## The deal

It can be called business, venture, startup &mdash;
