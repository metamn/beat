  <p>  This is a comprehensive checklist to analyze a website from content, design, usability, experience, code to performance.</p>
<h2 id="message">Message</h2>
<p>  What this website tells you in the first few seconds, after the first skim through?</p>
<pre><code>  Athfield Architects is a modern architecture company with a really unique design, even more is one of the most pleasant websites I&#39;ve seen recently.

  Perhaps their work is in the same way elegant, well executed, unique, ahead of the hype.
</code></pre><pre><code>  Lars Muller Publishers ... wooow !!! :) One of the best websites I&#39;ve seen lately. I like that camel animation, that blue minimal buttons, and how the books are presented. Simple, entertaining, beautiful.
</code></pre><pre><code>  Collaborative Fund is something I don&#39;t really understand. They try to explain me with nice graphics but this is not my world and I&#39;m hardly getting their message. All I know they do investments.
</code></pre><h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>  What this website tells you after a second, more in deep re-read?</p>
<pre><code>  Athfield is a architecture company with a clear, well sounding mission: &quot;Architecture has a social responsibility&quot;.

  They are from New Zealand and probably a bunch of young, kind people.

  They roll out quite often new buildings / works which are not the best I&#39;ve seen but in line with the trends. They must have their own groove, since the design suggest (the spacers) something cool, pleasant surprise in every work they done.
</code></pre><pre><code>  Lars Muller is a new, modern publisher probably with well selected books. They are like Taschen but perhaps with better price / quality ratio. I should check back to buy books from here, they must be interesting.

  I really like the collections; they must be well themed and discounted. I really want to buy that white collection.

  These books are presented in such way you immediately want to buy all of them. Interesting, very well done.
</code></pre><pre><code>  It must be a Silicon Valley venture capital company operating with latest buzzwords I don&#39;t really trust (&quot;leading source of capital&quot;, &quot;pushing the world forward&quot;).

  The graphics for use cases / different sections are ok as connectors but it is very difficult to realize what they mean. Reading the section titles &quot;Cities&quot;, &quot;Kids&quot; gives more clarity to the graphic, but once my eye jumped from these headlines to the illustration above I don&#39;t jump back to read what&#39;s behind the headline.

  I see some links telling this is a very serious company (Lyft, TaskRabbit). If the links were more accentuated maybe I would get the message better.
</code></pre><h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<p>  What are your first reactions after checking the site? What would you do next?</p>
<pre><code>  I will bookmark this site to my collection of Best Websites. I&#39;ll come back later to see it again.

  I would like to get updates from them, to establish a relationship, to get more exciting content but there are no social networks where to follow.
</code></pre><pre><code>  Bookmark it, then come back and buy some. And come back to re-see the site to enjoy myself.
</code></pre><pre><code>  Nothing
</code></pre><h2 id="remembering">Remembering</h2>
<p>  What you&#39;ll remember from this website?</p>
<pre><code>  The pleasant, spacey layout, overall mood, feeling.

  The animation

  The spacers
</code></pre><pre><code>  The blue, and the camel

  Those white books

  How to sell books
</code></pre><pre><code>  Those illustrations connecting sections, with pleasant colors.
</code></pre>
