  This is a comprehensive checklist to analyze a website from various viewpoints like content, design, usability, user experience, code, performance and more.

  ## Message

  What this website tells you in the first few seconds, after the first skim through?

  ```
  Athfield Architects is a modern architecture company with a really unique design, even more is one of the most pleasant websites I've seen recently.

  Perhaps their work is in the same way elegant, well executed, unique, ahead of the hype.

  Lars Muller Publishers ... wooow !!! :) One of the best websites I've seen lately. I like that camel animation, that blue minimal buttons, and how the books are presented. Simple, entertaining, beautiful.
  ```

  ```
  Collaborative Fund is something I don't really understand. They try to explain me with nice graphics but this is not my world and I'm hardly getting their message. All I know they do investments.
  ```

  ## Content

  What this website tells you after a second, more in deep re-read?

  ```
  Athfield is a architecture company with a clear, well sounding mission: "Architecture has a social responsibility".

  They are from New Zealand and probably a bunch of young, kind people.

  They roll out quite often new buildings / works which are not the best I've seen but in line with the trends. They must have their own groove, since the design suggest (the spacers) something cool, pleasant surprise in every work they done.

  Lars Muller is a new, modern publisher probably with well selected books. They are like Taschen but perhaps with better price / quality ratio. I should check back to buy books from here, they must be interesting.

  I really like the collections; they must be well themed and discounted. I really want to buy that white collection.

  These books are presented in such way you immediately want to buy all of them. Interesting, very well done.

  It must be a Silicon Valley venture capital company operating with latest buzzwords I don't really trust ("leading source of capital", "pushing the world forward").

  The graphics for use cases / different sections are ok as connectors but it is very difficult to realize what they mean. Reading the section titles "Cities", "Kids" gives more clarity to the graphic, but once my eye jumped from these headlines to the illustration above I don't jump back to read what's behind the headline.

  I see some links telling this is a very serious company (Lyft, TaskRabbit). If the links were more accentuated maybe I would get the message better.

  ## Action

  What are your first reactions after checking the site? What would you do next?

  ```
  I will bookmark this site to my collection of Best Websites. I'll come back later to see it again.

  I would like to get updates from them, to establish a relationship, to get more exciting content but there are no social networks where to follow.
  ```

  ```
  Bookmark it, then come back and buy some. And come back to re-see the site to enjoy myself.
  ```

  ```
  Nothing
