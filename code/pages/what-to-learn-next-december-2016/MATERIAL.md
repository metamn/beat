## Components

- They are standalone: you can use one of them, or the entire framework. Done with Lerna.js and Webpack
- Version management as NPM packages
- Gratefully degrading, they are no JS dependent
- They are initialized elegantly only when they are needed (components have lifecycles via `create` and `destroy`)
- They should contain documentation, tests and demos to get accepted
