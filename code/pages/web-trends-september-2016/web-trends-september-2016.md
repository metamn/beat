The web moves to be indistinguishable from Photoshop <sup id="footnote--1">[1](#footnotes--1)</sup> in layout, layers and mood.
Meantime is catching up with TV / video in motion and animation.

This first episode in *Web Trends* presents a few techniques marking this transition.

## Image on hover

A very pleasant experience seen lately on Afterall Studio, Grafik and Red October is revealing images when the visitor moves the cursor over a link.

In all cases, after the page load (no interaction yet), we have a calm layout and a well delivered message. When we start cruising the site we are rewarded with:

- a surprise
- very nice graphics
- which strengthens the message

## Horizontal scrolling

Horizontal scrolling is bad UX <sup id="footnote--2">[2](#footnotes--2)</sup>. I completely agree in cases when the horizontal scrollbar is visible. But these two examples are so smoothly executed they transform bad UX into something highly enjoyable.

## Custom spacers

This might be a personal favorite and not a real trend. I was interested long time ago how to fill white space with decorations other than color and image. Something typographic which suits well the text around.

Athfield Architects found a stunning solution which I'll take on a next level in upcoming projects. Yes, by adding animation.


## Background animation

First I saw them on the Lab 21 website and I was fascinated how well connects the different sections of the page. These small moving parts in the background makes you scroll more and reach the end of the page. Perfect to deliver long messages.


## Horizontal lines

This again is a personal favorite. I'm using simple lines, borders to connect or separate different elements on a page. I found these lines powerful and offering endless possibilities. Until I'll set type using the modern school <sup id="footnote--3">[3](#footnotes--3)</sup> I'll definitively use these decorators.

## Marquee

Haha. So nineties. Welcome back!

Scrolling text is an ancient way to deliver a message. In real life our eyes have fallen into the habit to always check a moving text. Now on web we transpile this habit and guess what: the first thing you notice on a webpage is the marquee.


## Raster images

With video came bandwidth saving. That's reducing the size of the content to the smallest, still enjoyable format. Such a technique is rastering, eliminating some pixels and even whole lines to reduce weight.

With the brutalist style rising<sup id="footnote--4">[4](#footnotes--4)</sup> this effect will be used by many.

## Rolling chars

It's like marquee but every single char is rotated, spinned during being displayed. It's clearly a trend which won't last long. Maybe it's just a hype.

## Custom cursors

Like rolling chars I suppose this will be a hype instead of a trend. It goes well with brutalism, it's so new it grabs attention immediately. It makes people click. It does everything but I'm afraid it will be overused and finally boring.

## 3D Typography

It's a clear trend yet in stealth mode. Lately we've seen fonts and font foundries creating outlined and animated type. I'm planning to use it.

## Strong Typography

Swiss style, German style, New York style. Typography radiating power and strength is evergreen. It might not be a trend just happening to me, or, to others who avoid the Apple visual ecosystem.

## Video

Video became part of the web, full class citizen as images are.

A year ago we've seen big, full-screen background videos now they are embedded invisibly into the flow. It is just a start. Soon every studio will have to have a motion graphics designer / producer.

## Scroll hijacking

The best we can have &mdash;  yet no support from browser vendors. Customizing website scrolling should be feature of the browser not something banned.

Right now it is very difficult to make it work across devices, so *kudos* to all who executed well.
