// Slider with image
//
// Experimental :
// In a slider without image everything is ok. With an image we should specify the exact dimensions of the image otherwise the slider will truncate it.
// The intrinsic ratio mixin is a way to define the dimensions of an image in a fully responsive way.
//
@mixin slider--with-image {
  // The `slider` must have the intrinsic ratio set !!!
  // Do it in the calling code
  //@include intrinsic-ratio(3, 4, '.slider__slides');

  .figure {
    @include figure(stretched);
  }
}
