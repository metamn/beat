// Slider with image
//
// Experimental :
//
// In a slider without image everything is ok. With an image we should specify the exact dimensions of the image.
// Otherwise the slider will truncate it.
// The intrinsic ratio mixin is a way to define the dimensions of an image in a fully responsive way.
//
// When using the intrinsic ratio all images must have exactly the same dimensions and they must have the exact aspect ratio
//
// To create 2x, retina landscape and portrait screenshots with this monitor:
// - landscape 16:9 - screenshot 1920x1080 (2x), resize to 960 for 1x
// - portrait 3:4 - screenshoot 900x1200 (2x), resize to 450x for 1x
// => with this monitor cannot be created fullscreen retina screenshots
//
// To have 2x, retina friendly images:
// - landscape 16:9 - 2x: 3840x2160 => 1920x1080
// - portrait 3:4 - 2x: 1536x2048 => 768x1024
//
@mixin slider--with-image {
  // The `slider` must have the intrinsic ratio set !!!
  // Do it in the calling code
  //@include intrinsic-ratio(3, 4, '.slider__slides');

  .figure {
    @include figure(stretched);
